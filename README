# Django Generic Articles
A simple abstract model for article type content.
On many projects I find myself needing a content type that has a title, publish date, publish status, excerpt, and description.
I created this app to store this informaiton in abstract model so I could create new models faster.
The app also contains: 
A Manager class that filters object by publish status.
An Admin class with an action for toggling the publish status.
An Admin Form that adds an 'mceEditor' class to the description field for hooking in a TinyMCE editor.
